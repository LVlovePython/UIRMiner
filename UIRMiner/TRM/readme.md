## This project is the source code of algorithm UIRMiner.

It contains three virants: $UIRMiner_{nsc}$, $UIRMiner_{nc}$, and $UIRMiner$.

$UIRMiner_{nsc}$ is the algorithm that does not use storage compression.

$UIRMiner_{nc}$ is the algorithm that does not use complement utility pruning strategy.

Note that the java file "Algo_nmc" is the algorithm $UIRMiner_{nsc}$.
